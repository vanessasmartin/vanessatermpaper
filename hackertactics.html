	<p>The easiest way to steal information is through social engineering. Social engineering is
the use of deception to manipulate individuals into willingly giving up confidential or personal
information. Social engineers are essentially con-men . “Playing on victims emotions, social
engineers employ a diversity of tactics to impact the emotional state of the victim, thus
influencing their willingness to divulge confidential information. (Holt)” Social engineers appeal
to people’s primal emotions such as greed, fear and joy. Everyone is predisposed to cognitive
bias which causes people to believe information provided to them which may influence bad
decisions.</p> <br>
		
<h2>Phishing</h2>

<p>Social engineering is a common tactic in Phishing scams. Phishing acts deceive people
into submitting their personal information like credit card and social security numbers. Phishing
attacks look like emails and websites that look like they come from legitimate sources such as
banks and utilities companies but the operators are not affiliated with any legitimate
organization.Spearfishing targets known patrons of businesses. “ Cybercriminals know that if you
get an email that looks like it's from your medical provider and it's talking about a surgery you
had last year, you are more likely to believe it. (O’Mara) ”</p> <br><br>
		
		
<h2>Ransomware</h2>

<p>Companies are increasingly seeing ransomware attacks. Ransomware is malicious code
written by hackers that turns computers into “zombies.” These computers are controlled by the
hacker until the company grants the hacker a sum of money. Ransomware is a form of extortion.
It is common for ambitious cyber criminals target government organizations, hospitals,
universities and corporations. Although attackers are usually motivated by money however some
attackers are weaponized .</p>
