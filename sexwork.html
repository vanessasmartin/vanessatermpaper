	<p>Similar to online drug marketplaces the websites that fuel the online sex industry employ
Web 2.0 technologies such as message boards and forums where sex workers and their potential clients can interact directly without meeting physically. Web 2.0 technologies refer to “Internet
based communications that feature a high degree of user interactivity and the generation of
mediated content by those same users. (Yar)” <br><br>
		
Clients are able to build a reputation by writing
reviews. These reviews can either help or damage the escort’s business. Sex workers who solicit
online also utilize technologies like online payment systems such as PayPal. It is common for sex
workers to thoroughly screen and do background checks on clients. Social media pages such as
Facebook or LinkedIn can be used to choose is a client’s identity if authentic. Other online
resources are available for screening clients such as blacklists compiled by the global sex work
community warning against people that have put a sex worker in danger.</p>
