	<p>The Internet has allowed criminal activity to occur without the perpetrators having to
physically interact with another party. More than half of the world’s population uses the Internet
which allows people that participate in illegal activity to have a wide selection of people to
target. Cyber crime “ a crime that has some kind of computer or cyber aspect to it.(Symantec) ”
Crime meaning “ an illegal act for which someone can be punished by the government
(Merriam-Webster) ” These crimes include drug trafficking, prostitution, fraud and intellectual
property theft. <br><br>
		
		Many of these crimes that appear virtually have existed as physical events and
adapted to the digital format. The Internet is also used for terrorist acts and there is the possibility
for a cyber war. The Internet has afforded ordinary people to perform criminal acts across
borders and on a global scale. Digital crimes are becoming increasingly more complex because
the Internet is not bounded by geography or location.Cyber criminals are motivated by a number
of reasons such as financial gain, fame amongst their peers or to make a political statement. To
combat cyber crime many nations have organizations dedicated to protect their citizens as well as
themselves from being targeted by people with malicious intentions.</p>
